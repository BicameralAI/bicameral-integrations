"""webhook_risk mod — advisory webhook-safety signals (ADR-0013).

EM-safe (ADR-0007/0008): reads immutable ``AdapterEmission`` evidence and returns advisory
artifacts only — it never accepts a webhook event, executes a mutation, or sends a notification.
Pure function over the input list (no I/O): signals come only from the emission text.

Deterministic detection (lowercased contiguous-substring match, NOT a parser):

- **webhook context** — the text references a webhook handling surface (``webhook``, a provider
  signature header, ``svix``, ``hmac``). Always annotated (the change touches webhook safety).
- **named risk** — the text additionally names a concrete webhook risk (``replay``, ``spoof``,
  ``unverified``, ``bypass``, ``missing signature``, ``no dedup``): routes to security review.

Absence-of-a-mention is deliberately NOT treated as a risk (a change can verify without saying
so) — only an explicitly named risk routes. No webhook context → NO output.
