# Connectors

Connectors are provider-facing components. They know external APIs, auth flows,
pagination, retries, webhook signatures, and provider-native ids.

Each connector exposes a small **parse surface** — one or more
`parse_*(payload) -> Observation` functions plus a `<Provider>Connector` class
declaring its `source_id` and supported modes. Connectors return raw or lightly
structured provider observations; the [universal adapter](../adapter/README.md)
turns those observations into Bicameral emissions via `pipeline.normalize()`.
Connectors are read-only evidence adapters — they never write canonical state
(ADR-0008).

Live network, auth, and webhook-signature paths are deferred per connector and
documented in each connector's `auth.md`; the implemented surface this cycle is
payload parsing, exercised against synthetic fixtures.

"Verify" = webhook signature verification (`verify()`/`normalize_event()` HMAC +
dedup) is wired; "—" = parse-only or live verification deferred.
